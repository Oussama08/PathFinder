# PathFinder
This Project is about Pathfinding Visualizer Using Famous Algorithms , such as A* and Dijkstra's . I built this application because I was interested by these kind of algorithms , and I wanted to visualize them in action , so i choose Pathfinding Ones.
You Can see it Here : https://oussama08.github.io/PathFinder/ , using Google chrome .

# Some Used Algorithms :

Dijkstra's Algorithm : the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path

A Search* : arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm

Greedy Best-first Search (weighted): a faster, more heuristic-heavy version of A*; does not guarantee the shortest path

Swarm Algorithm (weighted): a mixture of Dijkstra's Algorithm and A*; does not guarantee the shortest-path
